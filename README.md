# 🍃 Nurture — Baby Cry Analyzer

> Understand what your baby is trying to tell you.

Nurture is a **React + TypeScript** web app that records or accepts uploaded baby cry audio, extracts acoustic features (MFCC, Chroma, Mel Spectrogram), and classifies the cry into one of **11 categories** — hungry, tired, belly pain, discomfort, scared, lonely, cold/hot, burping, noise, laugh, or silence. Each result includes a confidence score, probability breakdown, and practical soothing tips.

The app runs **entirely in simulation mode by default** — no backend needed. It optionally connects to a local **FastAPI + scikit-learn** server for real ML inference.

## 📦 Dependencies

These are all the npm packages used across the codebase:

### Core

```bash
npm install react react-dom
npm install typescript
```

### Framer Motion (animations & transitions)

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

### Lucide React (icons)

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### Tailwind CSS v4 + animation plugin

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
npm install tw-animate-css
```

### shadcn/ui (used in not-found and toast components)

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toast
```

> shadcn components (`Card`, `Toast`) require the `@/` path alias configured in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` — see [Path Alias Setup](#path-alias-setup) below.

### Dev dependencies

```bash
npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react
npm install -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

### Full install (all at once)

```bash
npm install react react-dom framer-motion lucide-react tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite tw-animate-css @radix-ui/react-toast
npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nurture-baby-cry-analyzer.git
cd nurture-baby-cry-analyzer
```

**2. Install all dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Start development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**4. Open in browser**

```
http://localhost:5173
```

App starts in **Sandbox mode** — no backend required. Use the sample library or upload any audio file to test.

---

## ⚙️ Path Alias Setup

The shadcn components use `@/` imports. Make sure these configs are in place:

**`tsconfig.json`**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**`vite.config.ts`**
```ts
import path from 'path'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
})
```

---

## 🔧 Build & Preview

```bash
# Production build (outputs to /dist)
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

---

## 🐍 Optional: FastAPI Backend (Real ML Inference)

By default, the app simulates analysis. To use a real trained model:

**1. Set up the Python environment**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Minimum `requirements.txt`:**
```
fastapi
uvicorn
scikit-learn
numpy
librosa
python-multipart
```

**2. Add your model files to `/backend`**

```
backend/
├── main.py
├── best_model.pkl      # trained stacking ensemble
└── scaler.pkl          # fitted feature scaler
```

**3. Run the server**

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

**4. Connect the app**

In the Analyze tab, switch **Sandbox → Python API**. The app will ping `/health` to confirm connection, then POST audio to `/predict`.

**Expected `/predict` response shape:**
```json
{
  "matchedLabel": "hungry",
  "confidence": 89.4,
  "probabilities": { "hungry": 0.894, "tired": 0.04, ... },
  "features": {
    "mfcc": [...],
    "chroma": [...],
    "mel": [...]
  }
}
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment

**Netlify**

```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

**Vercel**

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

Both deploy the static `/dist` folder with zero additional config needed.

⚠️ Disclaimer
Nurture is a parenting aid, not a replacement for an actual doctor, pediatrician, or that one auntie who claims she can tell what a baby wants just by looking at them. If your baby seems unwell, please consult a qualified medical professional — not an app, not Google, and definitely not a Reddit thread from 2014.

We analyze cries. We do not cure them. That's still on you. Sorry.

If this helped you survive parenthood, consider giving it a ⭐ — it won't make your baby sleep, but it'll make us feel better.
